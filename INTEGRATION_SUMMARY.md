## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
1. **Public Access**: Home page accessible without authentication
2. **Auth Required**: App routes (dashboard, builder) require authentication
3. **Auto-redirect**: Authenticated users can navigate freely, non-auth users redirected to signin

### Navigation Logic
- **Authenticated Users**: See dashboard and builder links, user menu, sign out
- **Non-authenticated Users**: See sign in link, main CTA buttons
- **Mobile**: Collapsible menu with full navigation available

### Project Management
- **Dashboard**: Shows user's projects with stats and quick actions
- **Project Manager**: Reusable component for project listing with filtering
- **Builder Integration**: Ready for integration with builder workflow

### Database Schema Integration
- Projects table with proper relationships
- User-based project filtering
- Project status and type management
- Support for collaboration features

## Next Steps for Complete Integration

1. **Database Connection**: Connect to actual Supabase database for real project data
2. **Builder Workflow Integration**: Connect ProjectManager to actual builder steps
3. **Real-time Updates**: Implement real-time project updates
4. **Export Features**: Add actual export functionality to Figma/Webflow/React
5. **Team Features**: Implement collaboration and sharing features
