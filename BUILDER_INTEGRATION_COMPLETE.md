  - Automatic redirect to sign-in for unauthenticated users
- **Layout Updates**:
  - Root layout no longer wraps everything in AuthGuard
  - Flexible routing for public and private pages

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Route Structure
```
/ (Public) - Landing page
├── /auth/* - Authentication pages
└── /app/* (Protected) - Application pages
    ├── /dashboard - User dashboard
    ├── /builder - AI Site Builder
    └── /settings - User settings (future)
```

### Authentication Flow
1. **Public Access**: Home page and auth pages accessible to everyone
2. **Protected Routes**: Dashboard and builder require authentication
3. **Smart Redirects**: Unauthenticated users redirected to sign-in
4. **Session Management**: Automatic session handling with Supabase

### Component Hierarchy
```
App Layout
├── Nav (unified navigation)
├── AuthGuard (route protection)
├── Page Content
│   ├── Dashboard Page
│   ├── Builder Page
│   └── Project Manager
└── Toaster (notifications)
```
